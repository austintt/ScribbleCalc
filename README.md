A requirement for graduation from BYU-I in the Software Engineering program is to complete a senior project. Said project has to have a computer science focus in which the student has not had previous experience and have a duration of at least 156 hours in design and development.

For my senior project I’ve chosen to focus on the topic of computer vision, by created an iOS app written in Swift which uses the iPhone’s camera to capture a handwritten math problem. The app will then segment the image into individual characters, recognize what character was written (using the KNN algorithm along with the MNIST dataset), solve the math problem, and display the results to the user.
